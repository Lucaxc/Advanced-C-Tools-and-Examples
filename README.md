# Advanced C Tools and Examples

Code snippets to test and get familiar with advanced C structures. The purpose of this repository is to provide full free access to those who would like to review some concepts or to get familiar with some new structures.
This repository is based on personal experience and knowledge, hence any suggestion is greatly appreciated.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository includes a series of C files that can be downloaded and run on a personal computer. All the files are equipped with extensive commentary and multiple examples that can be accessed by commentind/decommenting portions of code.

A personal suggestion would be to run the code with Visual Studio Code.

- Download Visual Studio Code at the link: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Once it is downloaded, install the following extensions in the extension tab: C/C++, CMake, Code Runner
- To run the code, save the code and right click on the screen in the Visual Studio environment, then choose 'Run Code'
